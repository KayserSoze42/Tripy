_Love, Peace and **Unity3D**._

_Well, 2D, and a plan for a further ½ of a dimension.._

As a big Android enthusiast, I loved the idea of _short_ games like [Dumb Ways To Die](https://www.dumbwaystodie.com/), [Fruit Ninja](https://www.halfbrick.com/games/fruit-ninja) and _other_ games like [Limbo](https://playdead.com/games/limbo/), [Minecraft PE/BE](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-android) and [Terraria.](https://terraria.org/)

I heard about a certain [herb](https://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/x5mqiz/south-park-medicinal-fried-chicken-season-14-ep-3), considered the _niche market need_ and gave it a go.

It's buggy as hell (you can kinda moonwalk, lol), very flashy, rough, unfinished and maybe even 2tripy4me..

But again.

It's probably one of the most interesting (to me) [Pp][Oo][SsCc] projects I had the pleasure of working on. And you can kinda moonwalk. Lol.

It was written in [_**C#**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E2%99%AF_(musical_note)) and powered, of course, by [Unity☮](https://unity.com/)

I created the artwork in Inkscape, and went from no idea to this version in less than [7 days](https://www.csfd.cz/film/43514-kruh/prehled/)

It's one of my pet projects and I'm definetely going to give it another try. I have lost all of the Unity / Inkscape files and would have to start from scratch.

_Well I say, that just sounds like refactoring with extra steps._

You can check [one](https://github.com/KayserSoze42/Tripy/tree/main/flight_of_the_ufo) of the ideas I kinda started working on and be thankful that's where I stopped, lol.

I have learned a lot about mathematics and physics in video games, dealing with forces and vectors, parrallax "scrolling" effect and did some of my shadiest mathematical solutions.

I have learned about the ecosystem, how to try and save some memory and also use that memory in bestest of ways. 

I have learned about the openness of the sources in the Android community, and a general strive for the _**root factor.**_

And a lot more I forgot.

Let me know what you think. 

Feel free to steal.

"And keep on rockin' in the free world."
